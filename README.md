# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
My Graduation Project from the University of Jordan. 
we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS for the front end, and Firebase for both backend, database, and hosting, since it provides an effective BaaS 
(Back-End as a Service)

The most important and notable features were a fully navigational map of the IT faculty building that marks classrooms and the facilities of the building. 
Also, graphical representations of multiple study plans which were user interactive and function as a tracker for the studying journey for the student
It also had other features like a dynamic GPA calculator that calculates the GPA immediately for the student, and some services that are presented in a 
nice way to guide students for the available resources.
The most notable challenges to be mentioned is implementing a smart and intuitive way for the map to work, and since we are using a document NoSQL database, 
we had to come up with a creative way to update the state of the course once done on the study plan, we decided to use the flexibility of ReactJS to turn the 
CSS ClassName function into a JavaScript variable, that changes upon clicking on the button, and the background gets dimmed so it can indicate the completion 
of the course.

Another challenge was the implementation of a GPA calculator in ReactJS, since there were not many resources for building a GPA calculator at the time in React, 
we had to improvise and create our own code.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
