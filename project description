My Graduation Project from the University of Jordan. 
we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS for the front end, and Firebase for both backend, database, and hosting, since it provides an effective BaaS 
(Back-End as a Service)

The most important and notable features were a fully navigational map of the IT faculty building that marks classrooms and the facilities of the building. 
Also, graphical representations of multiple study plans which were user interactive and function as a tracker for the studying journey for the student
It also had other features like a dynamic GPA calculator that calculates the GPA immediately for the student, and some services that are presented in a 
nice way to guide students for the available resources.
The most notable challenges to be mentioned is implementing a smart and intuitive way for the map to work, and since we are using a document NoSQL database, 
we had to come up with a creative way to update the state of the course once done on the study plan, we decided to use the flexibility of ReactJS to turn the 
CSS ClassName function into a JavaScript variable, that changes upon clicking on the button, and the background gets dimmed so it can indicate the completion 
of the course.

Another challenge was the implementation of a GPA calculator in ReactJS, since there were not many resources for building a GPA calculator at the time in React, 
we had to improvise and create our own code.
